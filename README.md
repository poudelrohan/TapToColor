## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

- The app could be expanded to let users customize the color range or choose favorite colors.
- Adding animations or sound effects on color change would make it more interactive.
- Could be used as a simple stress-buster app by providing satisfying visual feedback.

## Notes

While building the app, I had to figure out how to properly connect UI elements in the storyboard to Swift code using IBAction and IBOutlet. Resolving GitHub push and merge issues was a challenge at first, but I learned more about working with git and GitHub in the process.
